** Mini Project 1 **<br />
The script will take a csv file(Which is a file type to store tabular data like an excel file but a bit differently. Google for more.), which contains a column that contains random CGPA data of students and along with that, the other columns contain their preference order. The script will read the file and allot them branches based on their CGPA and preference and write them into a new csv file. 
A template file is provided to know where to start with. It contains comments telling you what to fill in and what to do to make your job a lot easier.
